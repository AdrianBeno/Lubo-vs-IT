# Release 1.0
This version is designed for our client's personal use only, and is not ready for further distribution.

## How to use:
The `.jar` and `.exe` applications found in the `Application` folder are the exact same application. The `.jar` file will only work if Java is installed. Read the **known issues** section before running the application. Both are ready to download and run.

## Known issues:
 - The application may freeze after `create` has been pressed. The application should still be creating PDFs in the background, and will unfreeze once finished (this may take a few minutes). Once all generation is finished, the application will produce a success message.
 - The application temporarily creates images and then deletes them in the same folder as itself. **To prevent other images with the same name being deleted, run this application from an empty directory!** 
 - The application may falsely trigger some anti-virus software warnings for ransomware (due to modifying a large amount of pictures described above).
 - The headers do not include the subject and teacher names
